# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks with calculations. 
They are referred to in the book, provide solutions to exercises or 
show details of calculations.
Some notebooks contain links to figures. 
They are stored in the subfolder `img`.
Make sure that you download the figures as well.  

The easiest way to use the notebooks is to clone this repository to your local computer 
and to work locally:
1. Option: use the terminal and the `git` command (for experts)
2. Option: use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), this is easier to use than the terminal version  `git` 
2. Option: use the Web-Interface 
    - go to [Main page](https://github.com/BuchEPP/Buch)
    - click on the green field `<>Code`
    - select `Download ZIP`

The comments in the notebooks are short.  So read the relevant section of the book carefully and try to understand every line of code.  Play with it: change parameters such as masses or vertex factors and see what happens. You can also use these notebooks as examples for calculating other processes.
